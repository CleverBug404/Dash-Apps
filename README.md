# Project_Two 

1) The most essential component of designing manageable, understandable, and adaptive code is to keep it brief, focused, and well-executed.
Any unnecessary code makes it more difficult to grasp the desired output.
Using the CRUD Python module simplified data administration, which was eventually sorted and converted into a visual dashboard in Project 2.
This might be utilized later for managing data, particularly huge amounts, where it has to be sorted, updated, read, and even produced. 



2) As a computer scientist, I tackle problems by breaking them down into the smallest components feasible.
In most cases, a flowchart is created, which is then transformed to pseudocode before the real code is produced.
This ensures that I write the shortest code feasible.
This course's assignments needed such methodologies, as well as research for the code being created.
Previous courses' code was maybe simpler or the implementation was simpler to grasp.
It required some time in this course to ensure that the best code was produced.
I would continue to employ similar tactics for database work in the future. 


3) Computer scientists distill complicated things down into their most basic components.
They then take these concepts and turn them into the greatest code that can be produced.
This involves ensuring that the code is clear and well written.
This can assist a corporation with enormous files, such as Grazioso Salvare, in sorting and managing the data in a more straightforward manner.
It would be extremely difficult to manage such enormous volumes of data without automation.
